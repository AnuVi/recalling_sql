# recalling_sql 
**Purpose**

I learned SQL years ago, but I haven't used it for a while.

**Course**

[SQL for Data Analytics Learn SQL in 4 Hours ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) by _Luke Barousse_.

**Tools**
- [Sqliteviz](https://sqliteviz.com/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- online Markdown editor [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)

**Lessons**
- Postgresql / MySql :: DATE difference
- There are things that I have forgotten/haven't used:
  - BETWEEN
  - CASE
  - and now I have confusion *subquiries* vs *CTE* vs *JOINS*. I have learnt *subquiries*, but how JOINS/CTE come in-  more examples for myself to find how to use them.
- Postgresql/VSCode actually are strict with strings, need singular quotes('').
- If in trouble:
  - use Copilot as a learning partner
  - use Postgresql instead of VSCode, because it underlines the error, visually easier to spot the mistake
- I didn't get my VSCode and Github co-work, but it's ok.
- Still, during the next learning session upload also to Github at once, because of details I may not remember later.
